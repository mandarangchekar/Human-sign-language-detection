# Human-sign-language-detection
•	Developed a web application with a team of 4, for people with hearing loss who have difficulty communicating with others. By transcribing their hand signs into alphabets, the website was able to assist them.
•	To pre-process the data, a CNN model with a Con2D layer that used 64 filters and a maxPooling layer for dimensionality reduction was used. The data was gathered from Kaggle, which had 1570 columns. Relu and softmax functions were also used while pre-processing.
•	The CNN model was well trained and tested which could successfully classify between different hand signs and gave a accuracy score of 88% while avoiding overfitting. The project has a future scope.
